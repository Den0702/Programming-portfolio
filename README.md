## What I learned during my time at Akademia 108
During the course, I learned how to work with the triplet - HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, practiced the interaction of front-end code with APIs implementing versatile tasks and projects. I also learned how to create web pages more efficiently using a suitable tool for this - the SASS preprocessor. And finally learned how to build web user interfaces with React library having a chance to create and implement graphic design and my own vision of responsive layout here, to test the app and fix discovered bugs.
